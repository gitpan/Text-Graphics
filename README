This is a toolkit for rendering plain text via an API like that used
for graphics rendering in GUI toolkits.  This package might be used
when perls native C<format> runs out of steam, or when you want to do
sophisticated rendering of plain text, e.g., for graphing, creating of
complex forms for email and fax, and so on.
